powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Win10-Tc3-Check.ps1
```

#### Windows 11

### Troubleshooting

Depending on your system settings you may see the following error message.

This simply means that you did not run CMD as an administrator, you did not use the bypass, or the running of scripts has been disabled on your system.

If you are unable to execute the script following these instructions then this is outside of what is possible to diagnose. You will need to contact your IT department. The restrictions you are seeing with running the script are likely to be interfering with the installation of TwinCAT.
